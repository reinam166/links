1. ### **Persona 5 Royal**
Persona 5 royal is a turn base JRPG devloped by ATLUS and part of the persona series as a whole. The game follows a group of high school students in Tokyo who lead double lives as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. They enter a virtual world known as the Metaverse to confront corrupt adults and change their hearts by stealing their distorted desires known as "treasures". The game is beautifully made with amazing visuals and a soul touching soundtrack.Even while this game was released in 2019 it still holds up to this day and is considered one of the greatest games of all time. I personally put this game as my number one and wish I could play this game for the first time again. I highly recommend this game to try but be wary as this game takes time investment and can have a playthourgh of around 100+ hours.
