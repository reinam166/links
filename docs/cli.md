### **1.  Persona 5 Royal**
Persona 5 Royal is a turn base JRPG developed by ATLUS and part of the Persona series as a whole. The game follows a group of high school students in Tokyo who lead double lives as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. They enter a virtual world known as the Metaverse to confront corrupt adults and change their hearts by stealing their distorted desires known as "treasures". The game is beautifully made with amazing visuals and a soul-touching soundtrack. Even while this game was released in 2019 it still holds up to this day and is considered one of the greatest games of all time. I personally consider this game my number one, and I wish I could play this game again for the first time. I highly recommend this game to try but be wary as this game takes time investment and can have a playthrough of around 100+ hours.

### **2.  Super Smash Brothers Ultimate**
Fighting Games are my favourite genre of games to play, nothing beats playing as your main character and battling out against your opponent. Traditionally Fighting games are flat playing fields that are known as side scrollers but Smash is known as a platform fighter meaning on top of a battlefield, there are platforms for movement options and setups for combos. It's a unique twist from many of the other fighting games they don't offer and is generally easier to pick up compared to games like Tekken and StreetFighter. Having said that, I love all fighting games but Smash offers enjoyment to fighting 1v1 I can't get elsewhere.

### **3. Genshin Impact**
Genshin Impact is the main game I play every day now. It's an open-world RPG allowing you to explore and fight monsters as you level up your characters to get them stronger. As you explore around there are chests and puzzles to solve to gain currency. You save up an amount and pull on the gatcha system for the desired character you want. The game offers a new story every patch and has spanned for 7 years for each of the own 7 nations. This game has helped me through quarantine and I still have so much enjoyment and anticipate for what comes next in the story.
